The park consists of five blocks declared between 1938-1973 under the Fauna and Flora Protection Ordinance and is managed by the Department of Wildlife Conservation. Wilpattu National Park spans across the Puttalam and Anuradhapura districts, and borders the Mannar and Vavuniya Districts. The area is one of the most important elephant habitats in the country and is also a great place to observe the elusive Sri Lankan leopard and the sloth bear.",
